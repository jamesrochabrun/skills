#### engineer-skill-creator

**Transform extracted expertise into actionable skills with progressive disclosure.** Takes engineer profiles from the extractor and creates structured, queryable skills that AI agents can use to find relevant expertise for specific tasks.

**Key features:**
- Progressive disclosure system (show only what's needed)

- Quick reference guides
- Automatic categorization

**Usage:**
- "Create a skill from engineer profile"
- "Transform expertise into queryable format"
- "Generate progressive disclosure navigation"
- "Package expertise for agent use"

**Workflow:**
```bash
# Step 1: Extract expertise
./extract_engineer.sh senior_dev

# Step 2: Create skill (THIS TOOL)
./create_expert_skill.sh senior_dev

# Step 3: Use with agents
"Using expert-skills/senior-dev-mentor/, implement auth"
```

**Output Structure:**
```
expert-skills/[name]-mentor/
├── SKILL.md (documentation)
├── query_expertise.sh (interactive query)
├── expertise/
│   ├── by_task/ (auth, API, testing, etc.)
│   ├── by_language/ (TypeScript, Python, etc.)
│   ├── by_pattern/ (DI, repository, etc.)
│   └── quick_reference/ (style, naming, etc.)
└── examples/ (real code samples)
```

**Progressive Disclosure:**
Instead of dumping all expertise at once, agents query specific needs:
- "How do they handle authentication?" → Gets only auth patterns
- "TypeScript coding style?" → Gets only TS conventions
- "Repository pattern?" → Gets only that pattern

**Perfect for:**
- Making expertise searchable and queryable
- Enabling task-specific guidance
- Creating AI agent training materials
- Building onboarding resources
- Scaling knowledge across teams

**Use with agents:**
```
"Using expert-skills/senior-dev-mentor/, write a user service
following their patterns and style"

"Using expert-skills/tech-lead-mentor/, review this code using
their standards"
```

**Requirements:** Completed engineer profile from engineer-expertise-extractor

**The Complete Workflow:**
1. **Extract:** `engineer-expertise-extractor` → Creates profile
2. **Create:** `engineer-skill-creator` → Transforms into skill
3. **Use:** Reference skill in agent prompts → Get expert guidance
