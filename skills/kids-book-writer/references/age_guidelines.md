Chapter 1: The Worst Day Ever (Probably)

I'm Lily, and today was the worst day of my entire second-grade life.

Okay, maybe not the ENTIRE worst. That would be the day I
accidentally called my teacher "Mom." But this was definitely in
the top three.

It started this morning when I couldn't find my lucky pencil.
The purple one with the unicorn eraser.
I NEEDED that pencil for our spelling test.

"Lily, any pencil will work," Mom said.

But that's where she was wrong. My lucky pencil helped me spell
big words like "because" and "they."

Without it? I might spell "because" like "bekuz." And then everyone
would know I didn't have my lucky pencil, and then they'd know I
was bad at spelling without it.

See? Disaster.

Then, at recess, something even worse happened...
